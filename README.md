# Info Box
This template was created to make the WebApp developing process simple and accessible to everyone who loves the [Laravel]([url](https://laravel.com/)) and [Vue.js]([url](https://vuejs.org/)). 
The core of the entire sistem is [Inertia.js]([url](https://inertiajs.com/)), which it let you build a WebApp without creating an API. I also chose to integrate tailwindcss for a better experience in customizing the web app. To install it locally, here are the following steps:

# Requirements
<li>WLS2 or Linux or MacOS</li>
<li>PHP and Node.js (8.2 and v18 at least)</li>
<li>Composer and npm</li>
<li>git</li>
